While taking CPSC 52 (Computer Architecture), I got interested in writing optimized low-level code. This repo contains 3 attempts at writing optimized Quicksort code in MIPS Assembly (and debugging it using MARS).

## standard_quicksort
My first implementation of a Quicksort algorithm, created individually for a lab assignment.
## improved_quicksort
standard_quicksort with tweaks, such as using pointers within loops and performing swap() in-line. I created this and improved_mid_quicksort with Michelle Zhuang '23 for a final project.
## improved_mid_quicksort
Based on the Hoare partition scheme, this works faster on almost-sorted lists.
