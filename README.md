While taking CPSC 52 (Computer Architecture), I got interested in writing optimized low-level code. This repo contains 3 attempts at writing optimized Quicksort code in MIPS Assembly, which I wrote for a lab assignment as well as a paired final project with Michelle Zhuang '23:

# standard_quicksort
My first implementation of a Quicksort algorithm.
# improved_quicksort
standard_quicksort with tweaks, such as using pointers within loops and performing swap() in-line.
# improved_mid_quicksort
Based on the Hoare partition scheme, this works faster on almost-sorted lists.
